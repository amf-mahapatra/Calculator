Create calculator layout:
    button section arranged in caculator keyboard fashion
    create operations section - add subtract multiply divide equal clear
    create display section
        needs to add each digit as selected
        clear when new digits are entered after operation button
        refresh with result when equal or new operation button is pressed

1 populate the screen
2 get value from screen
3 clear the screen
4 get operation
5 perform operation

narrative:
User will enter digits or decimal point and as digits are entered they will
be added to the screen in the far right postion pushing the characters toward
the left.

If a decimal point is clicked it first checks if the string already
contains a decimal point and adds the point if no other point exists.

When an operation button is clicked the operation type is recorded 
and the screen contents are read and added as the first value in an array.

When the user begins to enter another number the screen is cleared first then
the second number is added to the display the same as the first.

When the user clicks the equal sign or another operation the second number is
added to the array and the operation is performed. After the operation is performed
the screen is cleared and the result is written to the screen.

After the operation is performed the result becomes the first item in the array
and the other items in the array are cleared

calulation array = [n1, operation, n2]



hitting the clear button resets the array to empty
